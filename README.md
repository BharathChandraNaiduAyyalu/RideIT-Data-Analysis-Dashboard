# RideIT-Data Analysis-Dashboard
The RideIt Data Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into ride-sharing data and drivers data through meticulous data cleaning, in-depth analysis, and visually appealing dashboards. This project leverages Excel for data cleaning, MySQL for data analysis, and Power BI for dashboard creation.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Excel**: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **MySQL**: Data analysis
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and visualization

## Data Cleaning (Excel)

The data was cleaned and preprocessed using Excel to remove any inconsistencies, null values, and duplicates. Various Excel functions and formulas were used to ensure the data was ready for analysis.

## Data Analysis (MySQL)

The cleaned data was imported into MySQL for further analysis. SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as:

- Total active drivers?
- Total offers received by drivers?
- Total bookings accepted by drivers?
- Total cancellations done by passenger and drivers?
- Total no of cancellation done by passenger?
- Total no of cancellation done by drivers?
- Total rides completed?
- Day with the most cancellations of rides?
- Day with the most offers are received for rides?
- Day with most bookings accepted by drivers?
- Day with most rides completed?
- Percentage of offers received by drivers?
- Percentage of cancellations?
- Percentage of bookings?
- Percentage of completed rides?
- In which month more rides are completed?

## Dashboard (Power BI)

A comprehensive dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize the analysis results.The dashboard includes:

- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Interactive charts and graphs
- DASHBOARD IMAGES : https://github.com/BharathChandraNaiduAyyalu/RideIT-Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/DASHBOARD%20FILE.IMG.pdf
